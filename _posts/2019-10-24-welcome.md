Welcome to the new FCTL website. We're in the process of migrating everything from our old WordPress site to this new site which is hosted on Github Pages. Our site uses a Jekyll template forked from the [uwsampa template](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web). In the coming weeks we'll be adding more information about our research projects and the incredible people who work in our lab. In the meantime, please excuse the mess as we replace the filler content with our actual content.
