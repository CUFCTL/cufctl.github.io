In response to the HFEHRI (Hands-Free Electronic Health Record Data Entry Initiative) solicitation for research to demonstrate and validate hands-free electronic health record data entry solutions that will operate reliably in noisy operational environments, alleviate disruption of care for documentation, and prevent loss of documentation, this project studies a systemoriented approach to meet these objectives with a platform aimed to enable resilient hands-free data collection, preserve complete documentation through stages of care, and present timely information useful for the medical operation.
