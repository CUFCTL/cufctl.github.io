Machine Learning is a field which is becoming increasingly useful in a wide variety of domains due to the accumulation of large amounts of raw data (“big data”) and the availability of high-performance computing (HPC) systems which can process this data.  These domains include image processing, natural language processing, autonomous driving, gene set analysis, molecular structure classification, and many others.  The goal of this Creative Inquiry is to equip students with the various skills required to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, which includes data-related issues such as how to select and load a dataset, software-related issues such as how to implement a machine learning pipeline from basic components, and hardware-related issues such as how to best take advantage of GPUs and other high-performance computing resources.  Students will gain hands-on experience with machine learning / big data by working on a real-world problem of their choice.
